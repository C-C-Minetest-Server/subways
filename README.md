# [Minetest](https://minetest.net/) Subways

This mod aims to add several unique, real subways to the [Advanced Trains](https://advtrains.de) mod, which seems to have a lack of good-looking subways. I will be actively adding more subways, so keep an eye out for new trains! Also, I'll be taking suggestions for any trains y'all want to see implemented; take a look below for more information.

## Have any ideas and/or subway requests?

If you have any ideas for more types of subways I could add, or if you have a particular subway in mind you'd like me to make, I encourage you to [create an issue](https://github.com/SamMatzko/minetest-subways/issues/new) telling me the specific subway you want me to add! I make all the subway models myself, so your train does need to be one I can find pictures of online (just for reference). Unless something drastic happens, your subway request should be complete in a two weeks at the most, a few days if I'm really on top of things.
