[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sylvester_kruin/subways/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sylvester_kruin/subways/)

### Note: a new updated version will be released on ContentDB sometime in the next few months. Here is what's being done:

- [X] Add a Brown Subway Wagon
- [X] Update the subway names so they're not just named after their colors
- [ ] Redo the Green Subway Wagon (with support for [Advtrains Livery Tools](https://github.com/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools))
- [ ] Add the P3010 LRV (as in [#6](https://github.com/SamMatzko/minetest-subways/issues/6))
- [ ] Add the HR4000 subway (as in [#6](https://github.com/SamMatzko/minetest-subways/issues/6))
- [ ] Redo the Red Subway Wagon (with support for [Advtrains Livery Tools](https://github.com/Marnack/advtrains_livery_tools))

### The rest of this README will be updated when version 2 is released on [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net)

This mod aims to add several unique, real subways to the [Advanced Trains](https://advtrains.de) mod, which seems to have a lack of good-looking subways. I will be actively adding more subways, so keep an eye out for new trains! Also, I'll be taking suggestions for any trains y'all want to see implemented; take a look below for more information.

## Usage - Setting Train Color
Subways comes with an optional feature that enables you to change the color of your subway trains. In order to enable this functionality, install the [bike](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hume2/bike/) mod. You can then take the bike painter tool, right click to adjust the tool's color, and punch the train to set the train to that color.

## Have any ideas and/or subway requests?

If you have any ideas for more types of subways I could add, or if you have a particular subway in mind you'd like me to make, I encourage you to [create an issue](https://github.com/SamMatzko/minetest-subways/issues/new) telling me the specific subway you want me to add! I make all the subway models myself, so your train does need to be one I can find pictures of online (just for reference). Unless something drastic happens, your subway request should be complete in a two weeks at the most, a few days if I'm really on top of things.

## Contributors

Of course without the bugfixes and features provided by other awesome users, this mod just wouldn't be the same.
